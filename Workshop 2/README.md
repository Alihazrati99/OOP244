# Workshop 2 - Classes and Privacy in C++

## Introduction

This workshop focuses on working with classes and managing privacy in C++. Two main classes, `ProteinDatabase` and `TimedTask`, are implemented to handle protein information and measure the execution time of tasks.

## Files

### ProteinDatabase

- **ProteinDatabase.cpp:** Implementation file for the `ProteinDatabase` class.
- **ProteinDatabase.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `ProteinDatabase` class.

### TimedTask

- **TimedTask.cpp:** Implementation file for the `TimedTask` class.
- **TimedTask.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `TimedTask` class.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ ProteinDatabase.cpp TimedTask.cpp main.cpp -o "Workshop 2"
