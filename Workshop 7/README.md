# Workshop 7 - Bakery Management System


## Introduction

This workshop introduces a Bakery Management System implemented in C++. The system allows users to manage and display information about baked goods, including their type, description, shelf life, stock quantity, and price. The system also provides functionality to sort, combine, and check the stock status of the baked goods.

## Files

### Bakery

- **Bakery.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Bakery` class, `BakedGood` structure, and necessary enums.
- **Bakery.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Bakery` class member functions.

### w7_p2.cpp

- **w7_p2.cpp:** Main program file demonstrating the usage of the `Bakery` class. It includes sample commands to create a bakery, display goods, sort them, combine collections, and check stock status.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ Bakery.cpp w7_p2.cpp -o "Workshop 7"
