# Workshop 1 - Linkage, Storage Duration, Namespaces, and OS Interface

## Introduction

This workshop focuses on understanding linkage, storage duration, namespaces, and interacting with the OS interface. The main objective is to process food orders from input files and display relevant information about the orders.

## Files

- **w1_P2.cpp:** Main C++ source file that processes food orders.
- **FoodOrder.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `FoodOrder` class.
- **FoodOrder.cpp:** Implementation file for the `FoodOrder` class.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ w1_P2.cpp FoodOrder.cpp -o "Workshop 1"
