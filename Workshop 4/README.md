# Workshop 4 - Containers


## Introduction

This workshop focuses on implementing containers and managing resources in C++. It includes the implementation of the `Child`, `ConfirmOrder`, and `Toy` classes, showcasing concepts such as copy constructors, move semantics, and operators.

## Files

### Child

- **Child.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Child` class.
- **Child.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Child` class methods.
- **main.cpp:** Main file demonstrating the usage of the `Child` class.

### ConfirmOrder

- **ConfirmOrder.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `ConfirmOrder` class.
- **ConfirmOrder.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `ConfirmOrder` class methods.

### Toy

- **Toy.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Toy` class.
- **Toy.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Toy` class methods.

### ConfirmOrder

- **ConfirmOrder.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `ConfirmOrder` class.
- **ConfirmOrder.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `ConfirmOrder` class methods.

### data.txt

- Sample data file containing information about various toys.

### w4_p2.cpp

- Main program file demonstrating the usage of the implemented classes.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ Child.cpp ConfirmOrder.cpp Toy.cpp w4_p2.cpp -o "Workshop 4"


Description
This workshop explores the creation and management of dynamic arrays of objects, focusing on classes representing children, toys, and toy orders. The program reads toy information from a file, creates objects, and demonstrates various operations on these objects, including copying, moving, and interacting with containers.
