- **Station.cpp:** Implementation file for the `Station` class, including member functions for initialization, display, and data manipulation.

#### Station.h

- **Station.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Station` class.

#### Utilities.cpp

- **Utilities.cpp:** Implementation file for the `Utilities` class, including member functions for extracting tokens, managing delimiter, and cleaning spaces.

#### Utilities.h

- **Utilities.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Utilities` class.

### Compilation and Execution
