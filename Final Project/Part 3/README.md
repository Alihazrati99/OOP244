# Project Part 3 - Assembly Line Automation


## Introduction

This project continues the development of an Assembly Line Automation system, introducing the concept of workstations and line management. The implementation includes classes for CustomerOrder, Workstation, LineManager, and other related components.

## Files

### Workstation

- **Workstation.h:** Header file for the Workstation class.
- **Workstation.cpp:** Implementation file for the Workstation class.

### LineManager

- **LineManager.h:** Header file for the LineManager class.
- **LineManager.cpp:** Implementation file for the LineManager class.

### ms3.cpp

- Main program to demonstrate and test the functionality of the implemented classes.

### Stations1.txt

- Sample data file containing information about different types of workstations.

### Stations2.txt

- Another sample data file with additional workstation information.

### CustomerOrder.h

- Header file for the CustomerOrder class.

### CustomerOrder.cpp

- Implementation file for the CustomerOrder class.

### Utilities.h

- Header file for the Utilities class.

### Utilities.cpp

- Implementation file for the Utilities class.

### Station.h, Station.cpp

- Classes and implementation for the Station component.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ Workstation.cpp LineManager.cpp ms3.cpp CustomerOrder.cpp Utilities.cpp Station.cpp -o "AssemblyLine"
