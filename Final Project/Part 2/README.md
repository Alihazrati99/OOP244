# Project - Customer Order Management System (Part 2)


## Introduction

This project extends the development of a Customer Order Management System, focusing on the implementation of the `CustomerOrder` and `Station` classes. It also includes a program (`ms2.cpp`) to test and validate the functionality of these classes.

## Files

### CustomerOrder

- **f##CustomerOrder.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `CustomerOrder` class.
- **f##CustomerOrder.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `CustomerOrder` class methods.

### Station

- **f##Station.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Station` class.
- **f##Station.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Station` class methods.

### Utilities

- **f##Utilities.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Utilities` class.
- **f##Utilities.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Utilities` class methods.

### CustomerOrders.txt

- Sample data file containing customer orders.

### Stations1.txt

- Sample data file for the first set of stations.

### Stations2.txt

- Sample data file for the second set of stations.

### ms2.cpp

- Main program to test and validate the functionality of the implemented classes.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ f##CustomerOrder.cpp f##Station.cpp f##Utilities.cpp ms2.cpp -o "Project1"
