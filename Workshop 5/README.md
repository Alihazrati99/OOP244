# Workshop 5 - Classes and Operator Overloading


## Introduction

This workshop focuses on classes, operator overloading, and template classes in C++. It includes the implementation of the `Book`, `Collection`, `Movie`, and `SpellChecker` classes, showcasing the use of templates and various aspects of object-oriented programming.

## Files

### Book

- **Book.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Book` class.
- **Book.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Book` class methods.

### Collection

- **Collection.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Collection` template class.
- **Collection.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Collection` template class methods.

### Movie

- **Movie.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `Movie` class.
- **Movie.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `Movie` class methods.

### SpellChecker

- **SpellChecker.h:** Header file containing the declaration of the `SpellChecker` class.
- **SpellChecker.cpp:** Implementation file containing the definition of the `SpellChecker` class methods.

### data.txt

- Sample data file for the `Book` class.

### movies.txt

- Sample data file for the `Movie` class.

### words.txt

- File containing words for spell checking in the `SpellChecker` class.

## Compilation and Execution

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ Book.cpp Collection.cpp Movie.cpp SpellChecker.cpp w5_p1.cpp -o "Workshop 5"
